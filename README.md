# belly-button-challenge
Overview:

The goal of this project is to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset which contain microbial species within the human navels. 

Dashboard contents:

- A bar chart displaying the top 10 OTUs (Operational Taxonomic Units) found in the selected sample.
- A bubble chart showing the distribution of bacterial species in the sample.
- A dropdown menu to select different samples.
- A metadata panel showing demographic information about the selected sample.

Dashboard can be accessed here: https://jpvicencio.github.io/belly-button-challenge/

Technologies used:

The dashboard is built using D3.js and Plotly.js to display demographic information and visualizations of bacterial cultures in the samples.

•	D3.js: A JavaScript library for producing dynamic, interactive data visualizations.

•	Plotly.js: A JavaScript library for creating interactive charts.

•	Github: used to host the dashboard

Files:

•	index.html: sets up the structure of the dashboard

•	static/js/app.js: JavaScript file that contains the code for building charts and handling user interactions
